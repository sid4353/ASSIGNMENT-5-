# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
# 2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
# 3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
# 4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

step:1 take dictionary data where we have some data of student' name and marks.
step:2 there we take input from user for student name to showing student marks. 
step:3 in third line of code we use "if Stu in students:"
step:4 take 'm' veriable for contain value of key which are match with user input.
step:5 print(Stu+"'s","marks:",m)---(there we are print student name with marks).
step:6 in else statement we are print('student not found').


# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
# 3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
# 4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

step:1 first use 'l' which are contain list generate by list() with range(0,11)
step:2 print('original list: ',l) there we  are showing generated list
step:3 slicing list from original list "Ex=l[5:11]"
step:4 print('Extracted first five element:',Ex)---(in this line we are print first five digits from list)
step:5 re= Ex[-1:-7:-1] there we are reverse sliced list to "re" veriable
step:6 print('Reversed extracted elements:',re)
